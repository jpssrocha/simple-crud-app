# simple-crud-app

A simple web-app that runs a CRUD workflow with a simple SQLite database,
implemented for learning purposes. With it i'm learning to use the following
technologies to implement a REST like webapp:

- HTML
- CSS
    * Bootstrap
- Javascript
    * Node.js -> For backend programming
    * Express.js -> As webframework
    * EJS -> As a templating engine
    * Knex -> For database management and migrations
- SQL
    * SQLite3 -> on development
    * Postgres -> on deploy

The app is deployed via Heroku on:
